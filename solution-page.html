					<p>Fueled by the research gathered and guided by the defined audience and goals, I was able to create a Call To Action page which defined the main action a user would complete when visiting the website, as well as a Style Tile that shows the overall feeling of the redesigned website. The Style Tile includes the typeface pairing and sizes, the color palette, photography, and five adjectives that describe the feeling of the website. Also included are the main banner image with the Call To Action button and a navigation bar with secondary calls to action. I also redesigned the logo and wordmark for the nonprofit and included it in the top left of the Style Tile as it would appear on the redesigned website.

					<h2> Call To Action </h2>
					<p> My Call to Action page originally featured three different calls to action, as I could not decide on one based on my client interview. I thought that creating a scrolling banner with multiple options was the best idea, but after in-class critique I realized that this was not the case. I needed to prioritize my Call to Action, and the banner image with the 'Donate' button became the central Call to Action. </p>

								<h2> First Style Tile </h2>
								<p> All of my work thus far resulted in my first draft of a Style Tile. I included adjectives that described the feeling of the website, the color palette, a redesigned logo, potential imagery and textures, as well as the typography choices. This Style Tile was critiqued in class, and many suggestions and edits made. </p>

											<h2> Final Style Tile </h2>
											<p> Here is my final Style Tile (for now), where I filtered through my edits and critiques and made the necessary changes. I made the type weight heavier, as well as made the type larger. I got rid of one of my unnecessary colors, and prioritized my CTA's. I included the final Call to Action as the main banner that would appear on the front page of the website, along with a 'Donate' button. This resulted in a more cohesive Style Tile that more effectively communicates the feeling of the future website. </p>
