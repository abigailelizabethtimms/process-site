					<h2> Audience</h2>
					<p>To help narrow down the focus of the website, the audience and goals were defined. After analyzing the interview with the owner of the nonprofit, I began to list out all of the possible viewers and users of the size on Post It notes, dividing the similar ones up into categories. Then I thought about the overarching goals of the client, the audiences that I had defined previously, and the website. I also wrote these out on Post It notes, and ordered them from left to right, most important to least important. Once these were written out, I cross-examined them to see if any main goals were the same across all three categories, and these became my central goals, although they did change and become more specific over time. Finally, I figured out my specific goals, thinking about more narrowed down goals for smaller more defined groups of users. These specific goals led to identifying actions that the user could take, which guided my decisions when creating my Call to Action later in the process.</p>

					<h2> Overarching Goals</h2>
					<p>The broad goals of the three different audience categories.</p>

					<h2> Specific Goals</h2>
					<p>The more specific goals of narrowed down groups of users of the redesigned website.</p>
