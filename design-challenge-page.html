					<h2>What is the problem you are trying to solve?
					<p> Sponsoring birthday cakes for children whose parents  or guardians cannot afford them and providing employment for special needs adults.

					<h3> 1. Frame it as a design question</h3>
					<p> How can the website help garner more monetary and volunteer support for the charity's cause?</p>
					<h3> 2. State the ultimate impact you are trying to have</h3>
					<p> The ultimate impact of the website should be increased donations and orders, so the charity can employ more special needs adults, and sponsor more birthday cakes.</p>
					<h3> 3. What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
					<p> Clearer organization, distinct hierarchy, clear direction and division of users, succinct navigation bar, organized gallery of high-quality photos, prominently displayed awards, and updated charity information.</p>
					<h3> 4. Write down some contexts and constraints you are facing.</h3>
					<p> I have not yet visited the store to collect and review print literature, no new information/articles/awards to display, small charity, may be hard to collect information from those who have received services, and there are many groups of users to cater to.</p>
					<h3> The design question restated.</h3>
					<p> How do I create clearly distinguished user paths that will attract interest and effectively communicate to the many different groups of users?</p>
